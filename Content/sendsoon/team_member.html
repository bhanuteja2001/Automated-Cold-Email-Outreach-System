    <p>Hi {Name},</p>

    <p>
        I'm Bhanu, a grad student (May '25) from <b>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)</b> pursuing <b>Master of Science in
        Information Management</b> and currently working as a <b>Data Engineering Intern</b> at <b>AGCO Corporation</b>.  I'm reaching out because I'm really interested to be part of {Company}'s Data Team.
    </p>
    

    <p>
        I'm looking for opportunities in data, and {Company} stands out to me as an ideal place to start my professional career. 
        
        I’ve worked hard over the years to build the right skills and experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
        I noticed a job posting (<b>{role}</b>) that might be relevant to your team, but I’m not entirely sure. <b>If it is, and you feel my background could be a good fit, I’d be incredibly grateful if you could forward my resume to the hiring manager.</b> If not, I’d appreciate it if you could kindly direct me to the appropriate team or point of contact.
    </p>
    
    
     <p>
        I understand the market is incredibly competitive, and I truly appreciate any help or guidance you can provide. I’m available for a <b>full-time position starting May 2025</b>, and I’ve attached my resume for your reference.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you so much for your time and consideration! Looking forward to hearing from you!
    </p>

    <p>Best Regards,<br>
