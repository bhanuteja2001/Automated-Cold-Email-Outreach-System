    <p>Hi {Name},</p>

    <p>
    My name is Bhanu, and I’m a graduate student at the <b>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)</b>, pursuing a <b>Master of Science in Information Management (May '25)</b>. 
    Also, I’m currently an Advanced Analytics Intern at AGCO Corporation.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’m looking for opportunities to start my career in the field of data, and {Company} seems like an ideal place to do that. 
        If you have any openings that might fit my background, I’d be really excited to hear about them.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am available for a <b>full-time internship / co-op for Spring 2025 (Starting Jan 2025) or a full-time position starting May 2025.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you so much for your valuable time. I look forward to hearing from you!
    </p>


    <p>Best,<br>
