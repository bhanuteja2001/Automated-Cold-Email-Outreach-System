    <p>Hi {Name},</p>

    <p>
        I'm Bhanu, a grad student from <b>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)</b> pursuing <b>Master of Science in
        Information Management (Data Science & Analytics)</b> and currently working as <b>Advanced Analytics Intern</b> at <b>AGCO Corporation</b>. 
        I'm reaching out because I'm really interested to be part of {Company}'s Data Team.
    </p>

    <p>A bit about me:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Certified AWS AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Associate & AWS AWS-Certified-Machine-Learning-Specialty</b></li>
            <li>Started my Data Science Journey right from my sophomore year of undergrad.</li>
            <li>Extensive experience across diverse industries including <b>BFS,  AgriTech, SaaS, and EdTech</b> through various internships  and full-time.</li>
            <li><b>Experience working with end-to-end projects</b> involving Data Engineering, Data Science and MLOps.</li>
        </ol>

    <p>
        I'm looking for opportunities to grow in the field of data science, and {Company} seems like 
        an ideal place to do that. If you have any opportunities that might fit my background, I'd be really 
        excited to hear about them.
