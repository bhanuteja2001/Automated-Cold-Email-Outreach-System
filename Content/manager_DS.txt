    <p>Hi {Name},</p>

    <p>
        I'm Bhanu, a grad student (May '25) from the University of Illinois (UIUC) pursuing Master of Science in
        Information Management and currently working as a Advanced Analytics Intern at AGCO Corporation. 
        I'm reaching out because I'm really interested in joining the {Company}'s Data Team.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm looking for opportunities to grow in the field of data science, and {Company} seems like 
        an ideal place to do that. If you have any openings that might fit my background, I'd be really 
        excited to hear about them.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm available for a full-time internship for Spring 2025 or a full-time position starting May 2025. 
        I've attached my resume, and you can check out more of my work on my portfolio site: 
        <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/bhanukurakula/'>My Portfolio</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Looking forward to potentially chatting more about how I could contribute to {Company}!
    </p>

    <p>Best,<br>
