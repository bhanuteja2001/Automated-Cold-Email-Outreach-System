    <p>Hi {Name},</p>

    <p>
    My name is Bhanu, and I’m a graduate student at the University of Illinois (UIUC), pursuing a Master of Science in Information Management, graduating in May 2025. 
    I’m currently an Advanced Analytics Intern at AGCO Corporation.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’m looking for opportunities to start my career in the field of data, and {Company} seems like an ideal place to do that. 
        If you have any openings that might fit my background, I’d be really excited to hear about them.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am available for a full-time internship in Spring 2025 or a full-time position starting in May 2025. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your response.
    </p>
