    <p>Hi {Name},</p>

    <p>
        Hope you are having a wonderful day! I'm Bhanu, a grad student (May '25) from the <b>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)</b> pursuing <b>Master of Science in
        Information Management</b> and currently working as a Data Engineering Intern at AGCO Corporation. 
        I'm reaching out because I'm really interested to be part of {Company}'s Data Team.
    </p>

    <p>A bit about me:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Proven track record of designing and implementing robust data pipelines, with expertise in both <b>ETL and ELT methodologies</b>, ensuring efficient data processing and maintaining data quality standards.</li>
            <li>Extensive experience across diverse industries including <b>BFS,  AgriTech, SaaS, and EdTech</b>.</li>
            <li>Experience working with tools and platforms like <b>Databricks, Snowflake, AWS, dbt, Apache Airflow, and Alteryx</b>, showcasing a comprehensive skill set for modern data architecture.</li>
            <li>Ability to <b>automate/reduce manual effort using IaC (CloudFormation, Terraform)</b> and other best devops practices.</li>
        </ol>

    <p>
        I'm looking for opportunities to grow as a data engineer, and {Company} seems like 
        an ideal place to do that. If you have any openings that might fit my background, I'd be really 
        excited to hear about them.

        I'm available for a <b>full-time internship / co-op for Spring 2025 (Starting Jan 2025) or a full-time position starting May 2025.</b>
