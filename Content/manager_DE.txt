    <p>Hi {Name},</p>

    <p>
        I'm Bhanu, I recently graduated from <b>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)</b> with a <b>Master of Science in
        Information Management</b> and I have <b>over 2.5+ YoE in Data Engineering</b>.
    </p>

    <p>

        I saw that CVS has recently opened several Data Engineer positions, 
        so I'm reaching out because I'm really hoping to find an opportunity to interview and contribute to {Company}'s Data Engineering Team. 
        I've already applied to over 60 Data Engineer roles (all ones I’m genuinely qualified for), but for some reason, 
        nothing seems to be working out. If you know of any openings on your team or could share some useful advice, 
        I would really appreciate it. I strongly believe that {Company} will be the next best step in my career.


    </p>

    <p>A bit about me:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Experience <b>engineering robust data pipelines</b> handling large volumes of data using both <b>ETL and ELT</b>, ensuring efficient data processing and maintaining rigorous data quality standards.</li>
            <li><b>Collaborated with both technical and non-technical stakeholders</b> to develop robust <b>data models</b>, design intuitive <b>dashboards</b>, and define key business <b>metrics</b>.</li>
            <li>Diverse industry experience, including <b>Health, AgTech, Finance, and EdTech</b>, which has given me a broad perspective on data challenges across different sectors.</li>
            <li>Hands-on experience shipping data products while working with like <b>Tableau, Hadoop, Databricks, Snowflake, AWS, Airflow and Alteryx</b>.</li>
        </ol>

    <p>
    <b>
        I'm truly interested in joining {Company} and believe I could add value while continuing to learn and grow. 
        If there's anything available that matches my background—or even if you just have some advice, I would be grateful to hear from you.
    </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>I'm available to join immediately.</b>
        I've attached my resume, and you can also check out more of my work on my portfolio.
    </p>

    <p>
       Thank you so much for your time and consideration. Looking forward to any guidance or opportunities you can share!
