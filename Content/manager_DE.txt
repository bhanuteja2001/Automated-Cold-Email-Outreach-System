    <p>Hi {Name},</p>

    <p>
        I'm Bhanu, a grad student (May '25) from <b>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)</b> pursuing <b>Master of Science in
        Information Management</b> and currently working as a <b>Data Engineering Intern</b> at <b>AGCO Corporation</b>. 
        I'm reaching out because I'm really interested to be part of {Company}'s Data Team.
    </p>

    <p>A bit about me:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Experience designing and implementing robust data pipelines, with expertise in both <b>ETL and ELT</b>, ensuring efficient data processing and maintaining strong data quality standards.</li>
            <li>Diverse industry experience, including <b>BFS, AgTech, SaaS, and EdTech</b>, which has given me a broad perspective on data challenges across different domains.</li>
            <li>Hands-on experience in production environments with tools like <b>Databricks, Snowflake, AWS, Airflow and Alteryx</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Certified AWS AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Associate & AWS AWS-Certified-Machine-Learning-Specialty</b></li>
            <li>Ability to <b>automate/reduce manual effort using IaC (CloudFormation, Terraform)</b> and other best devops practices.</li>
        </ol>

    <p>
        I'm looking for opportunities to grow as a data engineer, and {Company} stands out to me as an ideal place to grow. 
        If you have any opportunities that might fit my background (now or in the future), I'd be really 
        excited to hear about them.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm available for a <b>full-time position starting May 2025.</b>
        I've attached my resume, and you can also check out more of my work on my portfolio site:
