Greetings {}, my name is Alex Jabbour.

I understand your time is valuable, I only have 3 things to say:

I've been developing object-oriented code and writing systematic python scripts since I was 13. I read a lot and not afraid to learn new technologies.

I have 1 year of experience working as a software engineer, managing cloud infrastructure, and developing microservices - 8 months of which in Silicon Valley.

I want to intern for {}. Can I forward my resume?

Warm regards,
Alex
